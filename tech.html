              <p>
                This is the first project that I've made. I decided to create this project because I wanted to work on something related to my favorite pastime—eating, admiring, and especially drinking coffee. As a coffee enthusiast, I thought, 'Why not?'
<br>
This project primarily showcases my creativity and my ability to combine colors to create a visually appealing design. I developed it using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To ensure responsiveness, I incorporated Bootstrap into the design. Additionally, I optimized it for search engines to make it SEO-friendly.

              The weather app was my first challenging yet enjoyable project. I delved deeply into advanced JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to bring it to life. Additionally, I had to learn and incorporate the integration of APIs. Despite its challenges, creating the app was immensely fun.
<br>
Bootstrap was integrated to enhance its responsiveness, and I ensured it is SEO-friendly as well.

              <p>
                The calculator was my second most challenging project, primarily because I tackled it solo. Inspired by the calculator on my phone, I decided to create my own version. I spent a lot of time refining its appearance to make it as perfect as possible, which pushed the boundaries of my JavaScript skills even further. While I hesitate to call it my favorite project yet, it was certainly both challenging and enjoyable to create.

              After gaining confidence in my JavaScript skills and grasping its essence, I embarked on creating a World Clock App. Inspired by the functionality of the app on my phone, particularly the one on my Huawei device, I aimed to replicate its features.
<br>
This app not only displays time but also includes an alarm, stopwatch, and timer functionalities. Users can search for cities to check their current time. To achieve this, I utilized API integration along with CSS, JavaScript, and HTML.
<br>
Moreover, I ensured the app is SEO-friendly and highly responsive by integrating Bootstrap.

                I developed this dictionary app to explore a slightly different aspect from my previous projects. Honestly, the biggest challenge was finding a free API that met my needs, but it was a rewarding endeavor nonetheless. 
<br>
I utilized CSS, HTML, and JavaScript to create the app, ensuring it's both functional and visually appealing. Additionally, I made sure it's responsive to different screen sizes, providing a seamless user experience across devices.

As I reviewed the job requirements, I realized I had the skills to produce something identical to the company's Job Application Portal, and I went for it. It felt empowering to know that I can just look at a project and decide to produce as it is.
<br>
This project also served as a test of my time management skills. With a goal to complete it in less than 5 hours, I practiced efficiency and focus. I'm pleased to say that I successfully met this challenge.
<br>
For the project, I utilized JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, ensuring that the final result was both visually appealing and functional.

              The Web Development Certificate from SheCodes Academy was my second certification, where I explored advanced JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The curriculum provided a deep dive into JS data types, functions, and API integration, essential for excelling in web development. Hands-on learning in Development Workflow equipped me with practical skills in optimizing workflows using Netlify and GitHub. Insights on hosting projects on Netlify via GitHub streamlined the deployment process. SheCodes Plus also enhanced my proficiency in Vanilla JS, reinforcing JavaScript concepts through practical projects. Overall, this program equipped me with crucial skills and knowledge to navigate modern web development effectively.
